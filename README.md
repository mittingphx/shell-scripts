# shell-scripts
Useful shell scripts that I'll want again later and other people might enjoy.

## MacOS Scripts

To install these scripts, you'll want to copy them to your /usr/local/bin folder and set execute permissions, replacing "your-script" with the filename of your script.
```
cp your-script /usr/local/bin
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/your-script
```

* [finder](finder) - Shell script to open the current folder in terminal within MacOS Finder.
* [hex](hex) - Script to open the first argument in Hex Fiend.app.  It has its own command line tool but it's faster to make a script than to search for it.
